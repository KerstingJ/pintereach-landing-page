The landing page will detail some of the features and benefits of the Pintereach research app.  

Pintereach will provide a visual organization of research articles that can be easily referred to later for further reading and research.  Similar to Pinterest, users will have the option of creating “research boards” that will contain visual thumbnails of various articles that have been chosen by the user to be saved to that board.  Once adding an article to the board, the user should be able to visually tag the article using a color.  (red for most important, yellow - moderate, green for low importance, and black - (default) for no importance.).  Each article will have a thumbnail visually rendered for easy identification.

The current list of features of the Pintereach app are:  
* Create Research Boards
* Add Articles
* Remove Articles
* Search for saved articles by keywords
* Move Articles to Different Boards via Drag & Drop
* Rename Reseearch Boards
* Ability to Follow Other users' research boards.
* Get notifications when boards you are following are updated.  
* Color Code Articles according to importance/relevance of content to the research
    * <strong style='color:red'>red</strong> = most imporant
    * <strong style='color:yellow'>yellow</strong> = moderate importance
    * <strong style='color:green'>green </strong>= low importance
    * <strong>black</strong>= no importance (default)
